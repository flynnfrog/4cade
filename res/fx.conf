Each line# of this file is a filename (not including comments, like this one). The# name of the next transition effect is stored in the global prefs, so this# file should not contain duplicates.## Transition effects are binary files loaded at $6000 and called with# hi-res page 1 showing and the next HGR graphic already loaded at $4000.# A transition effect has full use of main memory, including zero page and# text page if needed. LC RAM banks 1 and 2 are reserved for the launcher.## Important: LC RAM bank 1 will be read/write on entry and must be read/write# on exit. If you need ROM routines, you are responsible for switching to ROM# then switching back to RAM bank 1 (read/write) before returning.#
